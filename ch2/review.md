## Ch1 Exercises

### **1. What is the purpose of the "Hello, World! program?**

To output the message "Hello, World!" to the terminal.

### **2. Name the four parts of a function.**

Return type, name, arguments (parameter list), body.

### **3. Name a function that must appear in every C++ program.**

main()

### **4. In the "Hello, World!" program, what is the purpose of the line `return 0;`?**

Provides a return value for the main function; `0` indicates successful execution, 
while other numbers may indicate errors (in the case of a main function).

### **5. What is the purpose of the compiler?** 

The compiler reads your code (and not the comments) and converts it into object code,
to be passed to the linker.

### **6. What is the purpose of the `#include` directive?**

The `#include` directive tells the compiler what header files to reference when parsing
your source code. 

### **7. What does a `.h` suffix at the end of a file name signify in C++?**

The `.h` suffix signifies a header file, which is a collection of code written by others
that can be used in your project.

### **8. What does the linker do for your program?**

The linker takes your object code, and replaces references to header files with the contents of that reference.

### **9. What is the difference between a source file and an object file?**

A source file is a portable piece of C++ code/comments that can be compiled on many 
different systems. An object file is the system-specific output of the compiler, which 
is made up of object code.

### **10. What is an IDE and what does it do for you?**

And IDE is an Integrated Development Environment; a piece of software that is made to make 
development easier. It manages large projects, provides in-context explanations of snippets,
etc to make the developer's life easier. It also typically includes a compiler and linker
to create executable code for a number of systems, not necessarily limited to the 
development system. 

### **11. If you understand everything in the textbook, why is it necessary to practice?**

Practice makes perfect, skills degrade without constant upkeep.
